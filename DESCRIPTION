Description: This package implements a post-order tree traversal meta-algorithm
    that computes phylogenetic stochastic mapping moments and likelihood
    derivatives of any order and scales linearly in the number of phylogeny
    tips.  Utility functions related to simulation-based stochastic mapping and
    higher-order continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) moment and derivative
    calculations are also provided.
